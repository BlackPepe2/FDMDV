Digitel Voice over HF radio.

This is the FDMDV source developped by HB9TLK, modem and initial idea by G3PLX

Very old (2008) program for windows. Best results with melp.dll vocoder. LPC10 and Speex sux.
Note this has a quite high crest factor, use on SSB in linear PA mode, set average power to 15% of max power.
