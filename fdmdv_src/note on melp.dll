/*
 * MELP 1400 bps rate-reduced variant (for FDMDV)
 *
 * Based on the original 2.4 kbit/s MELP reference implementation
 * released by the U.S. Department of Defense (MIL-STD-3005).
 * The original reference code is public domain / U.S. Government work
 * and was freely usable at the time of development.
 *
 * At the time of creation (2006–2008), the MELPe standard (with 1200/600 bps modes)
 * did not exist in any usable form for civilian or amateur developers and was
 * not available outside restricted military/commercial channels.
 *
 * Modification: extended voice frame / superframe size to reach ~1400 bps operation
 *               (slightly reduced quality)
 *
